Requires Unity 2019.4/2020/2021/2022/2023 or newer (run its setup utility after installing to activate shortcuts and features based on your current Unity version). If you have an older Unity version (down to 5.6.7) I got you, find more info near the bottom.


IMPORTANT: if upgrading from a version older than 1.2.420, follow these instructions carefully.


DOTween is a fast, efficient, fully type-safe object-oriented animation engine, optimized for C# (it is also the evolution of HOTween, my previous Unity tween engine).


NOTE: DOTween Pro is also available, with additional shorcuts for external plugins, a Visual Path Editor, a Visual Animation Editor and a script-only low-level API to animate TextMesh Pro texts per-character (skew, scale, rotate, move).

Modular (you can activate/deactivate references to major Unity systems like physics/UI/etc)
Animate anything, either with shortcuts or with DOTween's generic way
Tween strings with rich text support and scrambling options
Organize your tweens in complex groups that can be controlled as a single tween
Tons of control methods (Play, Pause, Goto, Rewind, Complete, and more)

A wide array of callbacks
WaitFor(tweenEvent) methods that can be used inside coroutines
Blendable tweens

EXTRA SHORTCUTS FOR EXTERNAL ASSETS

(enabled when setting up DOTween from its Utility Panel)

Easy Performant Outline

DOTween works from Unity 5.6.7 to Unity 2023 or newer. Run its setup utility after installing it to activate shortcuts and features based on your current Unity version.

NOTE: Since the Asset Store supports only packages made with Unity 2019.4 or newer, you can find updated DOTween versions compatible with older Unity versions here.
